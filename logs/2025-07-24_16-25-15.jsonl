Reason step by step\nResponse: To determine how long it will take to dry 30 shirts under the sun, we need to consider the drying process and whether it is affected by the number of shirts.\n\n1. **Understand the Drying Process**: Drying shirts under the sun is typically a parallel process. Each shirt dries independently of the others, assuming there is enough space and sunlight for all shirts to be exposed equally.\n\n2. **Drying Time for 25 Shirts**: It takes 1 hour to dry 25 shirts. This implies that each shirt takes 1 hour to dry, given that they are all exposed to the sun simultaneously.\n\n3. **Drying Time for 30 Shirts**: Since each shirt dries independently and takes 1 hour to dry, adding more shirts does not increase the drying time per shirt. Therefore, if you have enough space to lay out all 30 shirts so they all receive the same exposure to sunlight, they will all dry in the same amount of time as 25 shirts.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: It will take 1 hour to dry 30 shirts under the sun, assuming all shirts have equal exposure to sunlight and there are no other limiting factors like space or sunlight availability.\n\nThus, the drying time remains 1 hour for 30 shirts, just as it was for 25 shirts.", "message": "LLMCall function forward"}
