    "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nYou just started, no action has been performed yet.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher:id/workspace\" icon\nB. \"Home\" icon\nC. \"Phone\" icon\nD. \"Messages\" icon\nE. \"Chrome\" icon\nF. \"Calendar\" icon\nG. \"Search\" icon\nH. \"Sun, Oct 15\" icon\nI. \"Gmail\" icon\nJ. \"Photos\" icon\nK. \"YouTube\" icon\nL. \"Google app\" image\nM. \"Voice search\" image\nN. \"Google Lens\" button\nO. \"15:34\" icon\nP. \"Android System notification: \" image\nQ. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nR. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nS. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nT. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",

At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen?

Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail?

How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear.

    "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen?

What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action?

Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops?

Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",
    "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}.

Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"Select\" icon\nB. \"     \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af     \" icon\nC. \"CANCEL\" button\nD. \"15:35\" icon\nE. \"Android System notification: \" image\nF. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nG. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nH. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nI. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 9: Action executed, task still in progress.

Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen?

Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}.

Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}.

Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",
    "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one.

Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",
    "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}.

Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",
    "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}.

Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",
    "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}.

Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",
    "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}.

Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}.

Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",
    "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one.

Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 15: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\nStep 17: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to continue searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" as it was not found in \"DailyNotes,\" indicating it may still be in \"StudyGuides.\"\nStep 18: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in \"DailyNotes\"; the note remains elusive, indicating further exploration is needed in \"StudyGuides\".\nStep 19: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further scrolling may be necessary or consider alternative navigation options.\nStep 20: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further actions may be needed to find the note or explore alternative methods.\nStep 21: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in both \"StudyGuides\" and \"DailyNotes\" folders; this action initiated a search process, which may help in locating the note more efficiently.\nStep 22: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 8}. Clicked on \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" to confirm the search, but the screen did not change, indicating the search may not have executed; next, I should click the \"OK\" button to perform the search.\nStep 23: The parameter index is out of range. Remember the index must be in the UI element list!\nStep 24: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 0}. I attempted to open the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by clicking on its icon, but the action did not execute as expected; I need to find an alternative method to interact with the note directly.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"Search\" icon\nB. \"Recursive search in current directory.\" icon\nC. a \"Search\" text box with the text \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"\nD. a checkbox with the text \"Regex search\" that is checked\nE. a checkbox with the text \"Case sensitive\" that is not checked\nF. a checkbox with the text \"Search in content\" that is not checked\nG. \"CANCEL\" button\nH. \"OK\" button\nI. \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon\nJ. \"Back\" image\nK. \"Switch input method\" image\nL. \"More features\" icon\nM. \"Sticker Keyboard\" icon\nN. \"GIF Keyboard\" icon\nO. \"Clipboard\" icon\nP. \"Settings\" icon\nQ. \"Theme settings\" icon\nR. \"Voice input\" icon\nS. \"q\" icon\nT. \"w\" icon\nU. \"e\" icon\nV. \"r\" icon\nW. \"t\" icon\nX. \"y\" icon\nY. \"u\" icon\nZ. \"i\" icon\nAA. \"o\" icon\nAB. \"p\" icon\nAC. \"a\" icon\nAD. \"s\" icon\nAE. \"d\" icon\nAF. \"f\" icon\nAG. \"g\" icon\nAH. \"h\" icon\nAI. \"j\" icon\nAJ. \"k\" icon\nAK. \"l\" icon\nAL. \"Shift\" icon\nAM. \"z\" icon\nAN. \"x\" icon\nAO. \"c\" icon\nAP. \"v\" icon\nAQ. \"b\" icon\nAR. \"n\" icon\nAS. \"m\" icon\nAT. \"Delete\" icon\nAU. \"Symbol keyboard\" icon\nAV. \",\" icon\nAW. \"Emoji button\" icon\nAX. \"Space\" icon\nAY. \".\" icon\nAZ. \"Done\" icon\nBA. \"15:37\" icon\nBB. \"Android System notification: \" image\nBC. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nBD. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nBE. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nBF. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 23: Action failed - The parameter index is out of range. Remember the index must be in the UI element list!. Need to adjust approach.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 0}, Result: I attempted to open the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by clicking on its icon, but the action did not execute as expected; I need to find an alternative method to interact with the note directly.\nStep 24: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",
    "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one.

Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\nStep 17: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to continue searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" as it was not found in \"DailyNotes,\" indicating it may still be in \"StudyGuides.\"\nStep 18: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in \"DailyNotes\"; the note remains elusive, indicating further exploration is needed in \"StudyGuides\".\nStep 19: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further scrolling may be necessary or consider alternative navigation options.\nStep 20: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further actions may be needed to find the note or explore alternative methods.\nStep 21: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in both \"StudyGuides\" and \"DailyNotes\" folders; this action initiated a search process, which may help in locating the note more efficiently.\nStep 22: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 8}. Clicked on \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" to confirm the search, but the screen did not change, indicating the search may not have executed; next, I should click the \"OK\" button to perform the search.\nStep 23: The parameter index is out of range. Remember the index must be in the UI element list!\nStep 24: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 0}. I attempted to open the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by clicking on its icon, but the action did not execute as expected; I need to find an alternative method to interact with the note directly.\nStep 25: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 7}. Clicked the \"OK\" button to execute the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the search text was correctly inputted, but the expected results were not displayed, indicating the note may not be present in that folder.

Current strategy seems on track.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 7}, Result: Clicked the \"OK\" button to execute the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the search text was correctly inputted, but the expected results were not displayed, indicating the note may not be present in that folder. Next, I should explore other folders or check the note's location.\nStep 25: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",
    "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action.

Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action.

Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 15: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\nStep 17: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to continue searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" as it was not found in \"DailyNotes,\" indicating it may still be in \"StudyGuides.\"\nStep 18: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in \"DailyNotes\"; the note remains elusive, indicating further exploration is needed in \"StudyGuides\".\nStep 19: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further scrolling may be necessary or consider alternative navigation options.\nStep 20: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further actions may be needed to find the note or explore alternative methods.\nStep 21: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in both \"StudyGuides\" and \"DailyNotes\" folders; this action initiated a search process, which may help in locating the note more efficiently.\nStep 22: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 8}. Clicked on \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" to confirm the search, but the screen did not change, indicating the search may not have executed; next, I should click the \"OK\" button to perform the search.\nStep 23: The parameter index is out of range. Remember the index must be in the UI element list!\nStep 24: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 0}. I attempted to open the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by clicking on its icon, but the action did not execute as expected; I need to find an alternative method to interact with the note directly.\nStep 25: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 7}. Clicked the \"OK\" button to execute the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the search text was correctly inputted, but the expected results were not displayed, indicating the note may not be present in that folder. Next, I should explore other folders or check the note's location.\nStep 26: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"StudyGuides/NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon to access the note directly for moving it to \"DailyNotes,\" which successfully opened the note for further actions.\nStep 27: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 6}. I successfully opened the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by accessing the \"More options\" menu, which is necessary to move the note from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes\".\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"File settings\" icon\nB. \"Share\" icon\nC. \"Tools\" icon\nD. \"Info\" icon\nE. \"Reload\" icon\nF. \"15:38\" icon\nG. \"Android System notification: \" image\nH. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nI. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nJ. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nK. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 26: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 6}, Result: I successfully opened the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by accessing the \"More options\" menu, which is necessary to move the note from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes\".\nStep 27: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",
    "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one.

Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",
    "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action.

Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 15: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\nStep 17: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to continue searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" as it was not found in \"DailyNotes,\" indicating it may still be in \"StudyGuides.\"\nStep 18: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in \"DailyNotes\"; the note remains elusive, indicating further exploration is needed in \"StudyGuides\".\nStep 19: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further scrolling may be necessary or consider alternative navigation options.\nStep 20: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further actions may be needed to find the note or explore alternative methods.\nStep 21: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in both \"StudyGuides\" and \"DailyNotes\" folders; this action initiated a search process, which may help in locating the note more efficiently.\nStep 22: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 8}. Clicked on \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" to confirm the search, but the screen did not change, indicating the search may not have executed; next, I should click the \"OK\" button to perform the search.\nStep 23: The parameter index is out of range. Remember the index must be in the UI element list!\nStep 24: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 0}. I attempted to open the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by clicking on its icon, but the action did not execute as expected; I need to find an alternative method to interact with the note directly.\nStep 25: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 7}. Clicked the \"OK\" button to execute the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the search text was correctly inputted, but the expected results were not displayed, indicating the note may not be present in that folder. Next, I should explore other folders or check the note's location.\nStep 26: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"StudyGuides/NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon to access the note directly for moving it to \"DailyNotes,\" which successfully opened the note for further actions.\nStep 27: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 6}.

Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nYou just started, no action has been performed yet.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher:id/workspace\" icon\nB. \"Home\" icon\nC. \"Phone\" icon\nD. \"Messages\" icon\nE. \"Chrome\" icon\nF. \"Calendar\" icon\nG. \"Search\" icon\nH. \"Sun, Oct 15\" icon\nI. \"Gmail\" icon\nJ. \"Photos\" icon\nK. \"YouTube\" icon\nL. \"Google app\" image\nM. \"Voice search\" image\nN. \"Google Lens\" button\nO. \"15:34\" icon\nP. \"Android System notification: \" image\nQ. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nR. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nS. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nT. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above.

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"Markor\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"Folder .. \" icon\nM. \"Folder DailyNotes \" icon\nN. \"Folder StudyGuides \" icon\nO. \"15:34\" icon\nP. \"Android System notification: \" image\nQ. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nR. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nS. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nT. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}, Result: Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",
        "action_output": "Reason: I have successfully opened the Markor app, which is the first step towards moving the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" from the \"StudyGuides\" folder to the \"DailyNotes\" folder. The next logical step is to navigate to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note. I see that the UI elements include a \"Folder StudyGuides\" option, which I can click to access the contents of that folder. This will allow me to find the note I need to move.\n\nAction: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\":  N}",

You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"Markor\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"Folder .. \" icon\nM. \"Folder DailyNotes \" icon\nN. \"Folder StudyGuides \" icon\nO. \"15:34\" icon\nP. \"Android System notification: \" image\nQ. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nR. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nS. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nT. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}, Result: Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Action failed - Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!. Need to adjust approach.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}.

Based on user's goal/request, you may\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a history of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into an editable text field (specified by its index), this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is:In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\nNow I want you to summerize the latest step based on the action you pick with the reason and descriptions for the before and after (the action) screenshots.\nHere is the description for the before screenshot:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"Markor\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"Folder .. \" icon\nM. \"Folder DailyNotes \" icon\nN. \"Folder StudyGuides \" icon\nO. \"15:34\" icon\nP. \"Android System notification: \" image\nQ. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nR. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nS. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nT. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nHere is the description for the after screenshot:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:34\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nThis is the action you picked: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}\nBased on the reason: I have successfully opened the Markor app, but I need to navigate to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.

This is a logical next step as it will allow me to find the note I need to move.\n\n\nBy comparing the descriptions for the two screenshots and the action performed, give a brief summary of this step. This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selection like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might not be correct), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short and in one line.\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:34\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 3: Action failed - Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!. Need to adjust approach.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}, Result: Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 4: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",

Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into an editable text field (specified by its index), this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is:In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\nNow I want you to summerize the latest step based on the action you pick with the reason and descriptions for the before and after (the action) screenshots.\nHere is the description for the before screenshot:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:34\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nHere is the description for the after screenshot:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:34\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nThis is the action you picked: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}\nBased on the reason: I have successfully opened the Markor app and navigated to the \"StudyGuides\" folder. The next step is to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" within this folder. Since I have already clicked on the \"Folder StudyGuides,\" I need to look for the note itself. However, the current UI element descriptions do not provide a direct reference to the note. I will need to scroll down to see if the note is visible or if there are more elements that I can interact with. This will help me find the note to proceed with moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\n\n\nBy comparing the descriptions for the two screenshots and the action performed, give a brief summary of this step. This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selection like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might not be correct), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short and in one line.\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:34\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 4: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}, Result: Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 5: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",
        "action_output": "Reason: I have successfully opened the Markor app and navigated to the \"StudyGuides\" folder. I have also scrolled down to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt.\" The next step is to select this note for moving it to the \"DailyNotes\" folder. However, I need to ensure that I can see the note in the current view. Since the note is not listed in the UI elements provided, I will need to scroll again to find it. \n\nGiven that I have already scrolled down once, I will attempt to scroll down again to see if the note becomes visible. This is a logical next step to ensure I can access the note for moving it.\n\nAction: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}",

Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into an editable text field (specified by its index), this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is:In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\nNow I want you to summerize the latest step based on the action you pick with the reason and descriptions for the before and after (the action) screenshots.\nHere is the description for the before screenshot:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:34\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nHere is the description for the after screenshot:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:34\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nThis is the action you picked: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}\nBased on the reason: I have successfully opened the Markor app and navigated to the \"StudyGuides\" folder. I have also scrolled down to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt.\" The next step is to select this note for moving it to the \"DailyNotes\" folder. However, I need to ensure that I can see the note in the current view. Since the note is not listed in the UI elements provided, I will need to scroll again to find it. \n\nGiven that I have already scrolled down once, I will attempt to scroll down again to see if the note becomes visible. This is a logical next step to ensure I can access the note for moving it.\n\n\nBy comparing the descriptions for the two screenshots and the action performed, give a brief summary of this step. This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selection like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might not be correct), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short and in one line.\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:34\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 5: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}, Result: Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 6: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",
        "action_output": "Reason: The current situation involves being in the \"StudyGuides\" folder within the Markor app, where I am trying to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt.\" I have already attempted to scroll down twice, but the note is still not visible. Given that scrolling down has not yielded results, it may be beneficial to try scrolling up to see if the note is located higher up in the list. This approach is based on the understanding that sometimes items can be positioned unexpectedly, and a different scrolling direction may reveal the desired content.\n\nAction: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}",

Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into an editable text field (specified by its index), this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is:In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\nNow I want you to summerize the latest step based on the action you pick with the reason and descriptions for the before and after (the action) screenshots.\nHere is the description for the before screenshot:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:34\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nHere is the description for the after screenshot:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:35\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nThis is the action you picked: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}\nBased on the reason: The current situation involves being in the \"StudyGuides\" folder within the Markor app, where I am trying to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt.\" I have already attempted to scroll down twice, but the note is still not visible. Given that scrolling down has not yielded results, it may be beneficial to try scrolling up to see if the note is located higher up in the list. This approach is based on the understanding that sometimes items can be positioned unexpectedly, and a different scrolling direction may reveal the desired content.\n\n\nBy comparing the descriptions for the two screenshots and the action performed, give a brief summary of this step. This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selection like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might not be correct), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short and in one line.\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action.

Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:35\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 6: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}, Result: Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 7: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"Search\" icon\nB. \"Recursive search in current directory.\" icon\nC. a \"Search\" text box with the text \"Search\"\nD. a checkbox with the text \"Regex search\" that is not checked\nE. a checkbox with the text \"Case sensitive\" that is not checked\nF. a checkbox with the text \"Search in content\" that is not checked\nG. \"CANCEL\" button\nH. \"OK\" button\nI. \"15:35\" icon\nJ. \"Android System notification: \" image\nK. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nL. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nM. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nN. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 7: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}, Result: Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 8: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",

Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into an editable text field (specified by its index), this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is:In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\nNow I want you to summerize the latest step based on the action you pick with the reason and descriptions for the before and after (the action) screenshots.\nHere is the description for the before screenshot:\nA. \"Search\" icon\nB. \"Recursive search in current directory.\" icon\nC. a \"Search\" text box with the text \"Search\"\nD. a checkbox with the text \"Regex search\" that is not checked\nE. a checkbox with the text \"Case sensitive\" that is not checked\nF. a checkbox with the text \"Search in content\" that is not checked\nG. \"CANCEL\" button\nH. \"OK\" button\nI. \"15:35\" icon\nJ. \"Android System notification: \" image\nK. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nL. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nM. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nN. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nHere is the description for the after screenshot:\nA. \"Select\" icon\nB. \"     \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af     \" icon\nC. \"CANCEL\" button\nD. \"15:35\" icon\nE. \"Android System notification: \" image\nF. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nG. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nH. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nI. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nThis is the action you picked: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}\nBased on the reason: I have successfully opened the Markor app and navigated to the \"StudyGuides\" folder. However, I was unable to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" through scrolling. I clicked the \"Search\" icon to find the note more efficiently. Now, I need to input the name of the note into the search text box to locate it. The search text box is available, and I should type \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into it to proceed with the search.\n\n\nBy comparing the descriptions for the two screenshots and the action performed, give a brief summary of this step. This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selection like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might not be correct), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short and in one line.\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"Select\" icon\nB. \"     \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af     \" icon\nC. \"CANCEL\" button\nD. \"15:35\" icon\nE. \"Android System notification: \" image\nF. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nG. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nH. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nI. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 8: Action executed, task still in progress.

Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"Select\" icon\nB. \"     \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af     \" icon\nC. \"CANCEL\" button\nD. \"15:35\" icon\nE. \"Android System notification: \" image\nF. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nG. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nH. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nI. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 9: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}, Result: Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 10: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",

This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selection like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might not be correct), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short and in one line.\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

The available UI elements do not provide any indication of the search results or the note itself. Since I cannot see the note or any relevant options to proceed with moving it, I need to consider alternative actions. \n\nGiven that the search did not yield visible results, I should try to navigate back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to manually locate the note. This approach may allow me to find the note without relying on the search function, which may not be working as expected. \n\nAction: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"Select\" icon\nB. \"     \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af     \" icon\nC. \"CANCEL\" button\nD. \"15:35\" icon\nE. \"Android System notification: \" image\nF. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nG. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nH. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nI. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 10: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}, Result: Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 11: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:35\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 11: Action executed, task still in progress.

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:35\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 12: Action executed, task still in progress.

Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:36\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone three bars.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 13: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}, Result: Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 14: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",

Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 15: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:36\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone three bars.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 14: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}, Result: Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 15: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 15: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"> DailyNotes\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" icon\nM. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents\" icon\nN. \"15:36\" icon\nO. \"Android System notification: \" image\nP. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nQ. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nR. \"Phone three bars.\" icon\nS. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 15: Action executed, task still in progress.

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 15: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\nStep 17: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to continue searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" as it was not found in \"DailyNotes,\" indicating it may still be in \"StudyGuides.\"\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"Markor\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\" icon\nM. \"Folder DailyNotes 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nN. \"Folder StudyGuides 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nO. \"15:36\" icon\nP. \"Android System notification: \" image\nQ. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nR. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nS. \"Phone two bars.\" icon\nT. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 16: Action executed, task still in progress.

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 15: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\nStep 17: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to continue searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" as it was not found in \"DailyNotes,\" indicating it may still be in \"StudyGuides.\"\nStep 18: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in \"DailyNotes\"; the note remains elusive, indicating further exploration is needed in \"StudyGuides\".\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"Markor\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\" icon\nM. \"Folder DailyNotes 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nN. \"Folder StudyGuides 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nO. \"15:36\" icon\nP. \"Android System notification: \" image\nQ. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nR. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nS. \"Phone two bars.\" icon\nT. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 17: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}, Result: Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in \"DailyNotes\"; the note remains elusive, indicating further exploration is needed in \"StudyGuides\".\nStep 18: Action executed, task still in progress.

Based on user's goal/request, you may\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a history of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into an editable text field (specified by its index), this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is:In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\nNow I want you to summerize the latest step based on the action you pick with the reason and descriptions for the before and after (the action) screenshots.\nHere is the description for the before screenshot:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"Markor\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\" icon\nM. \"Folder DailyNotes 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nN. \"Folder StudyGuides 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nO. \"15:36\" icon\nP. \"Android System notification: \" image\nQ. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nR. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nS. \"Phone two bars.\" icon\nT. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nHere is the description for the after screenshot:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"Markor\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\" icon\nM. \"Folder DailyNotes 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nN. \"Folder StudyGuides 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nO. \"15:36\" icon\nP. \"Android System notification: \" image\nQ. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nR. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nS. \"Phone two bars.\" icon\nT. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nThis is the action you picked: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}\nBased on the reason: I have been trying to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, but it has not been visible despite multiple scrolling attempts. I previously navigated to the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the note there, but it was not found. Since the note is still elusive, I should consider that it might be located further down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder or that I may need to explore other options. Given that I have already scrolled down and up without success, I will try to scroll down again to see if the note appears, as it may be located at the bottom of the list.\n\n\nBy comparing the descriptions for the two screenshots and the action performed, give a brief summary of this step. This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selection like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might not be correct), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short and in one line.\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action.

Based on user's goal/request, you may\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a history of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into an editable text field (specified by its index), this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is:In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\nNow I want you to summerize the latest step based on the action you pick with the reason and descriptions for the before and after (the action) screenshots.\nHere is the description for the before screenshot:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"Markor\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\" icon\nM. \"Folder DailyNotes 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nN. \"Folder StudyGuides 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nO. \"15:36\" icon\nP. \"Android System notification: \" image\nQ. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nR. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nS. \"Phone two bars.\" icon\nT. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nHere is the description for the after screenshot:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"Markor\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\" icon\nM. \"Folder DailyNotes 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nN. \"Folder StudyGuides 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nO. \"15:36\" icon\nP. \"Android System notification: \" image\nQ. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nR. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nS. \"Phone one bar.\" icon\nT. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nThis is the action you picked: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}\nBased on the reason: The current situation involves being in the \"StudyGuides\" folder of the Markor app, where I have been trying to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt.\" Despite multiple scrolling attempts, the note remains elusive.

This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selection like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might not be correct), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short and in one line.\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 15: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\nStep 17: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to continue searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" as it was not found in \"DailyNotes,\" indicating it may still be in \"StudyGuides.\"\nStep 18: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in \"DailyNotes\"; the note remains elusive, indicating further exploration is needed in \"StudyGuides\".\nStep 19: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further scrolling may be necessary or consider alternative navigation options.\nStep 20: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further actions may be needed to find the note or explore alternative methods.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"Markor\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\" icon\nM. \"Folder DailyNotes 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nN. \"Folder StudyGuides 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nO. \"15:36\" icon\nP. \"Android System notification: \" image\nQ. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nR. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nS. \"Phone one bar.\" icon\nT. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 19: Action executed, task still in progress.

At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a history of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into an editable text field (specified by its index), this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is:In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\nNow I want you to summerize the latest step based on the action you pick with the reason and descriptions for the before and after (the action) screenshots.\nHere is the description for the before screenshot:\nA. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/main__view_pager_container\" icon\nB. \"Create a new file or folder\" button\nC. \"Markor\" icon\nD. \"Go to\" icon\nE. \"Sort by\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"Files\" icon\nI. \"To-Do\" icon\nJ. \"QuickNote\" icon\nK. \"More\" icon\nL. \"Folder .. /storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor\" icon\nM. \"Folder DailyNotes 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nN. \"Folder StudyGuides 10/15/2023, 15:34\" icon\nO. \"15:36\" icon\nP. \"Android System notification: \" image\nQ. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nR. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nS. \"Phone one bar.\" icon\nT. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nHere is the description for the after screenshot:\nA. \"Search\" icon\nB. \"Recursive search in current directory.\" icon\nC. a \"Search\" text box with the text \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"\nD. a checkbox with the text \"Regex search\" that is checked\nE. a checkbox with the text \"Case sensitive\" that is not checked\nF. a checkbox with the text \"Search in content\" that is not checked\nG. \"CANCEL\" button\nH. \"OK\" button\nI. \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon\nJ. \"Back\" image\nK. \"Switch input method\" image\nL. \"More features\" icon\nM. \"Sticker Keyboard\" icon\nN. \"GIF Keyboard\" icon\nO. \"Clipboard\" icon\nP. \"Settings\" icon\nQ. \"Theme settings\" icon\nR. \"Voice input\" icon\nS. \"q\" icon\nT. \"w\" icon\nU. \"e\" icon\nV. \"r\" icon\nW. \"t\" icon\nX. \"y\" icon\nY. \"u\" icon\nZ. \"i\" icon\nAA. \"o\" icon\nAB. \"p\" icon\nAC. \"a\" icon\nAD. \"s\" icon\nAE. \"d\" icon\nAF. \"f\" icon\nAG. \"g\" icon\nAH. \"h\" icon\nAI. \"j\" icon\nAJ. \"k\" icon\nAK. \"l\" icon\nAL. \"Shift\" icon\nAM. \"z\" icon\nAN. \"x\" icon\nAO. \"c\" icon\nAP. \"v\" icon\nAQ. \"b\" icon\nAR. \"n\" icon\nAS. \"m\" icon\nAT. \"Delete\" icon\nAU. \"Symbol keyboard\" icon\nAV. \",\" icon\nAW. \"Emoji button\" icon\nAX. \"Space\" icon\nAY. \".\" icon\nAZ. \"Done\" icon\nBA. \"15:37\" icon\nBB. \"Android System notification: \" image\nBC. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nBD. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nBE. \"Phone one bar.\" icon\nBF. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nThis is the action you picked: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}\nBased on the reason: I have been trying to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder by scrolling down multiple times, but it remains elusive.

Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short and in one line.\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 15: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\nStep 17: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to continue searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" as it was not found in \"DailyNotes,\" indicating it may still be in \"StudyGuides.\"\nStep 18: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in \"DailyNotes\"; the note remains elusive, indicating further exploration is needed in \"StudyGuides\".\nStep 19: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further scrolling may be necessary or consider alternative navigation options.\nStep 20: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further actions may be needed to find the note or explore alternative methods.\nStep 21: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in both \"StudyGuides\" and \"DailyNotes\" folders; this action initiated a search process, which may help in locating the note more efficiently.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"Search\" icon\nB. \"Recursive search in current directory.\" icon\nC. a \"Search\" text box with the text \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"\nD. a checkbox with the text \"Regex search\" that is checked\nE. a checkbox with the text \"Case sensitive\" that is not checked\nF. a checkbox with the text \"Search in content\" that is not checked\nG. \"CANCEL\" button\nH. \"OK\" button\nI. \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon\nJ. \"Back\" image\nK. \"Switch input method\" image\nL. \"More features\" icon\nM. \"Sticker Keyboard\" icon\nN. \"GIF Keyboard\" icon\nO. \"Clipboard\" icon\nP. \"Settings\" icon\nQ. \"Theme settings\" icon\nR. \"Voice input\" icon\nS. \"q\" icon\nT. \"w\" icon\nU. \"e\" icon\nV. \"r\" icon\nW. \"t\" icon\nX. \"y\" icon\nY. \"u\" icon\nZ. \"i\" icon\nAA. \"o\" icon\nAB. \"p\" icon\nAC. \"a\" icon\nAD. \"s\" icon\nAE. \"d\" icon\nAF. \"f\" icon\nAG. \"g\" icon\nAH. \"h\" icon\nAI. \"j\" icon\nAJ. \"k\" icon\nAK. \"l\" icon\nAL. \"Shift\" icon\nAM. \"z\" icon\nAN. \"x\" icon\nAO. \"c\" icon\nAP. \"v\" icon\nAQ. \"b\" icon\nAR. \"n\" icon\nAS. \"m\" icon\nAT. \"Delete\" icon\nAU. \"Symbol keyboard\" icon\nAV. \",\" icon\nAW. \"Emoji button\" icon\nAX. \"Space\" icon\nAY. \".\" icon\nAZ. \"Done\" icon\nBA. \"15:37\" icon\nBB. \"Android System notification: \" image\nBC. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nBD. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nBE. \"Phone one bar.\" icon\nBF. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 20: Action executed, task still in progress.

However, I have not yet executed the search to see if the note appears in the results. The next logical step is to confirm the search by clicking the \"OK\" button, which should execute the search and display any results related to the note.

Based on user's goal/request, you may\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a history of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into an editable text field (specified by its index), this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is:In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\nNow I want you to summerize the latest step based on the action you pick with the reason and descriptions for the before and after (the action) screenshots.\nHere is the description for the before screenshot:\nA. \"Search\" icon\nB. \"Recursive search in current directory.\" icon\nC. a \"Search\" text box with the text \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"\nD. a checkbox with the text \"Regex search\" that is checked\nE. a checkbox with the text \"Case sensitive\" that is not checked\nF. a checkbox with the text \"Search in content\" that is not checked\nG. \"CANCEL\" button\nH. \"OK\" button\nI. \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon\nJ. \"Back\" image\nK. \"Switch input method\" image\nL. \"More features\" icon\nM. \"Sticker Keyboard\" icon\nN. \"GIF Keyboard\" icon\nO. \"Clipboard\" icon\nP. \"Settings\" icon\nQ. \"Theme settings\" icon\nR. \"Voice input\" icon\nS. \"q\" icon\nT. \"w\" icon\nU. \"e\" icon\nV. \"r\" icon\nW. \"t\" icon\nX. \"y\" icon\nY. \"u\" icon\nZ. \"i\" icon\nAA. \"o\" icon\nAB. \"p\" icon\nAC. \"a\" icon\nAD. \"s\" icon\nAE. \"d\" icon\nAF. \"f\" icon\nAG. \"g\" icon\nAH. \"h\" icon\nAI. \"j\" icon\nAJ. \"k\" icon\nAK. \"l\" icon\nAL. \"Shift\" icon\nAM. \"z\" icon\nAN. \"x\" icon\nAO. \"c\" icon\nAP. \"v\" icon\nAQ. \"b\" icon\nAR. \"n\" icon\nAS. \"m\" icon\nAT. \"Delete\" icon\nAU. \"Symbol keyboard\" icon\nAV. \",\" icon\nAW. \"Emoji button\" icon\nAX. \"Space\" icon\nAY. \".\" icon\nAZ. \"Done\" icon\nBA. \"15:37\" icon\nBB. \"Android System notification: \" image\nBC. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nBD. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nBE. \"Phone one bar.\" icon\nBF. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nHere is the description for the after screenshot:\nA. \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon\nB. \"15:37\" icon\nC. \"Android System notification: \" image\nD. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nE. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nF. \"Phone one bar.\" icon\nG. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nThis is the action you picked: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 8}\nBased on the reason: The current situation involves the search interface in Markor, where I have successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box.

This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selection like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might not be correct), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short and in one line.\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}.

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 15: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\nStep 17: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to continue searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" as it was not found in \"DailyNotes,\" indicating it may still be in \"StudyGuides.\"\nStep 18: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in \"DailyNotes\"; the note remains elusive, indicating further exploration is needed in \"StudyGuides\".\nStep 19: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further scrolling may be necessary or consider alternative navigation options.\nStep 20: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further actions may be needed to find the note or explore alternative methods.\nStep 21: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in both \"StudyGuides\" and \"DailyNotes\" folders; this action initiated a search process, which may help in locating the note more efficiently.\nStep 22: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 8}. Clicked on \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" to confirm the search, but the screen did not change, indicating the search may not have executed; next, I should click the \"OK\" button to perform the search.\nStep 23: The parameter index is out of range. Remember the index must be in the UI element list!\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon\nB. \"15:37\" icon\nC. \"Android System notification: \" image\nD. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nE. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nF. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nG. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 8}, Result: Clicked on \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" to confirm the search, but the screen did not change, indicating the search may not have executed; next, I should click the \"OK\" button to perform the search.\nStep 22: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\nStep 23: Action failed - The parameter index is out of range. Remember the index must be in the UI element list!. Need to adjust approach.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",

At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a history of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into an editable text field (specified by its index), this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is:In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\nNow I want you to summerize the latest step based on the action you pick with the reason and descriptions for the before and after (the action) screenshots.\nHere is the description for the before screenshot:\nA. \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon\nB. \"15:37\" icon\nC. \"Android System notification: \" image\nD. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nE. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nF. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nG. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nHere is the description for the after screenshot:\nA. \"Search\" icon\nB. \"Recursive search in current directory.\" icon\nC. a \"Search\" text box with the text \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"\nD. a checkbox with the text \"Regex search\" that is checked\nE. a checkbox with the text \"Case sensitive\" that is not checked\nF. a checkbox with the text \"Search in content\" that is not checked\nG. \"CANCEL\" button\nH. \"OK\" button\nI. \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon\nJ. \"Back\" image\nK. \"Switch input method\" image\nL. \"More features\" icon\nM. \"Sticker Keyboard\" icon\nN. \"GIF Keyboard\" icon\nO. \"Clipboard\" icon\nP. \"Settings\" icon\nQ. \"Theme settings\" icon\nR. \"Voice input\" icon\nS. \"q\" icon\nT. \"w\" icon\nU. \"e\" icon\nV. \"r\" icon\nW. \"t\" icon\nX. \"y\" icon\nY. \"u\" icon\nZ. \"i\" icon\nAA. \"o\" icon\nAB. \"p\" icon\nAC. \"a\" icon\nAD. \"s\" icon\nAE. \"d\" icon\nAF. \"f\" icon\nAG. \"g\" icon\nAH. \"h\" icon\nAI. \"j\" icon\nAJ. \"k\" icon\nAK. \"l\" icon\nAL. \"Shift\" icon\nAM. \"z\" icon\nAN. \"x\" icon\nAO. \"c\" icon\nAP. \"v\" icon\nAQ. \"b\" icon\nAR. \"n\" icon\nAS. \"m\" icon\nAT. \"Delete\" icon\nAU. \"Symbol keyboard\" icon\nAV. \",\" icon\nAW. \"Emoji button\" icon\nAX. \"Space\" icon\nAY. \".\" icon\nAZ. \"Done\" icon\nBA. \"15:37\" icon\nBB. \"Android System notification: \" image\nBC. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nBD. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nBE. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nBF. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nThis is the action you picked: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 0}\nBased on the reason: I have successfully opened the Markor app and navigated to the \"StudyGuides\" folder.

The current UI elements indicate that the note is present, but I need to take a different approach to interact with it. Since the note is visible now, I can directly click on it to open it and then proceed to move it to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\n\n\nBy comparing the descriptions for the two screenshots and the action performed, give a brief summary of this step. This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selection like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might not be correct), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short and in one line.\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 15: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\nStep 17: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to continue searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" as it was not found in \"DailyNotes,\" indicating it may still be in \"StudyGuides.\"\nStep 18: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in \"DailyNotes\"; the note remains elusive, indicating further exploration is needed in \"StudyGuides\".\nStep 19: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further scrolling may be necessary or consider alternative navigation options.\nStep 20: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further actions may be needed to find the note or explore alternative methods.\nStep 21: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in both \"StudyGuides\" and \"DailyNotes\" folders; this action initiated a search process, which may help in locating the note more efficiently.\nStep 22: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 8}. Clicked on \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" to confirm the search, but the screen did not change, indicating the search may not have executed; next, I should click the \"OK\" button to perform the search.\nStep 23: The parameter index is out of range. Remember the index must be in the UI element list!\nStep 24: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 0}. I attempted to open the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by clicking on its icon, but the action did not execute as expected; I need to find an alternative method to interact with the note directly.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"Search\" icon\nB. \"Recursive search in current directory.\" icon\nC. a \"Search\" text box with the text \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"\nD. a checkbox with the text \"Regex search\" that is checked\nE. a checkbox with the text \"Case sensitive\" that is not checked\nF. a checkbox with the text \"Search in content\" that is not checked\nG. \"CANCEL\" button\nH. \"OK\" button\nI. \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon\nJ. \"Back\" image\nK. \"Switch input method\" image\nL. \"More features\" icon\nM. \"Sticker Keyboard\" icon\nN. \"GIF Keyboard\" icon\nO. \"Clipboard\" icon\nP. \"Settings\" icon\nQ. \"Theme settings\" icon\nR. \"Voice input\" icon\nS. \"q\" icon\nT. \"w\" icon\nU. \"e\" icon\nV. \"r\" icon\nW. \"t\" icon\nX. \"y\" icon\nY. \"u\" icon\nZ. \"i\" icon\nAA. \"o\" icon\nAB. \"p\" icon\nAC. \"a\" icon\nAD. \"s\" icon\nAE. \"d\" icon\nAF. \"f\" icon\nAG. \"g\" icon\nAH. \"h\" icon\nAI. \"j\" icon\nAJ. \"k\" icon\nAK. \"l\" icon\nAL. \"Shift\" icon\nAM. \"z\" icon\nAN. \"x\" icon\nAO. \"c\" icon\nAP. \"v\" icon\nAQ. \"b\" icon\nAR. \"n\" icon\nAS. \"m\" icon\nAT. \"Delete\" icon\nAU. \"Symbol keyboard\" icon\nAV. \",\" icon\nAW. \"Emoji button\" icon\nAX. \"Space\" icon\nAY. \".\" icon\nAZ. \"Done\" icon\nBA. \"15:37\" icon\nBB. \"Android System notification: \" image\nBC. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nBD. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nBE. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nBF. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 23: Action failed - The parameter index is out of range. Remember the index must be in the UI element list!. Need to adjust approach.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 0}, Result: I attempted to open the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by clicking on its icon, but the action did not execute as expected; I need to find an alternative method to interact with the note directly.\nStep 24: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",

Therefore, the best next action is to click the \"OK\" button to perform the search.\n\n\nBy comparing the descriptions for the two screenshots and the action performed, give a brief summary of this step. This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selection like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might not be correct), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short and in one line.\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

Clicked the \"OK\" button to execute the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the search text was correctly inputted, but the expected results were not displayed, indicating the note may not be present in that folder.

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 15: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\nStep 17: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to continue searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" as it was not found in \"DailyNotes,\" indicating it may still be in \"StudyGuides.\"\nStep 18: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in \"DailyNotes\"; the note remains elusive, indicating further exploration is needed in \"StudyGuides\".\nStep 19: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further scrolling may be necessary or consider alternative navigation options.\nStep 20: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further actions may be needed to find the note or explore alternative methods.\nStep 21: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in both \"StudyGuides\" and \"DailyNotes\" folders; this action initiated a search process, which may help in locating the note more efficiently.\nStep 22: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 8}. Clicked on \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" to confirm the search, but the screen did not change, indicating the search may not have executed; next, I should click the \"OK\" button to perform the search.\nStep 23: The parameter index is out of range. Remember the index must be in the UI element list!\nStep 24: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 0}. I attempted to open the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by clicking on its icon, but the action did not execute as expected; I need to find an alternative method to interact with the note directly.\nStep 25: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 7}. Clicked the \"OK\" button to execute the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the search text was correctly inputted, but the expected results were not displayed, indicating the note may not be present in that folder. Next, I should explore other folders or check the note's location.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"Select\" icon\nB. a \"Search\" text box with the text \"Search\"\nC. \"StudyGuides/NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon\nD. \"CANCEL\" button\nE. \"Back\" image\nF. \"Switch input method\" image\nG. \"1\" icon\nH. \"2\" icon\nI. \"3\" icon\nJ. \"4\" icon\nK. \"5\" icon\nL. \"6\" icon\nM. \"7\" icon\nN. \"8\" icon\nO. \"9\" icon\nP. \"0\" icon\nQ. \"q\" icon\nR. \"w\" icon\nS. \"e\" icon\nT. \"r\" icon\nU. \"t\" icon\nV. \"y\" icon\nW. \"u\" icon\nX. \"i\" icon\nY. \"o\" icon\nZ. \"p\" icon\nAA. \"a\" icon\nAB. \"s\" icon\nAC. \"d\" icon\nAD. \"f\" icon\nAE. \"g\" icon\nAF. \"h\" icon\nAG. \"j\" icon\nAH. \"k\" icon\nAI. \"l\" icon\nAJ. \"Shift\" icon\nAK. \"z\" icon\nAL. \"x\" icon\nAM. \"c\" icon\nAN. \"v\" icon\nAO. \"b\" icon\nAP. \"n\" icon\nAQ. \"m\" icon\nAR. \"Delete\" icon\nAS. \"Symbol keyboard\" icon\nAT. \",\" icon\nAU. \"Space\" icon\nAV. \".\" icon\nAW. \"Enter\" icon\nAX. \"15:37\" icon\nAY. \"Android System notification: \" image\nAZ. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nBA. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nBB. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nBC. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 24: Action executed, task still in progress.

I have also navigated to the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the note, but it was not found there either. Since the note is not appearing in the search results and I have not been able to locate it through scrolling, it may be beneficial to try a different approach. I will attempt to click on the \"StudyGuides/NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon directly, as it is listed among the UI elements and may allow me to access the note directly for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\n\nAction: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}",

\"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, but my search attempts have not yielded any results. I have also navigated to the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the note, but it was not found there either. Since the note is not appearing in the search results and I have not been able to locate it through scrolling, it may be beneficial to try a different approach. I will attempt to click on the \"StudyGuides/NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon directly, as it is listed among the UI elements and may allow me to access the note directly for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\n\n\nBy comparing the descriptions for the two screenshots and the action performed, give a brief summary of this step. This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selection like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might not be correct), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short and in one line.\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 15: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\nStep 17: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to continue searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" as it was not found in \"DailyNotes,\" indicating it may still be in \"StudyGuides.\"\nStep 18: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in \"DailyNotes\"; the note remains elusive, indicating further exploration is needed in \"StudyGuides\".\nStep 19: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further scrolling may be necessary or consider alternative navigation options.\nStep 20: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further actions may be needed to find the note or explore alternative methods.\nStep 21: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in both \"StudyGuides\" and \"DailyNotes\" folders; this action initiated a search process, which may help in locating the note more efficiently.\nStep 22: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 8}. Clicked on \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" to confirm the search, but the screen did not change, indicating the search may not have executed; next, I should click the \"OK\" button to perform the search.\nStep 23: The parameter index is out of range. Remember the index must be in the UI element list!\nStep 24: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 0}. I attempted to open the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by clicking on its icon, but the action did not execute as expected; I need to find an alternative method to interact with the note directly.\nStep 25: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 7}. Clicked the \"OK\" button to execute the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the search text was correctly inputted, but the expected results were not displayed, indicating the note may not be present in that folder. Next, I should explore other folders or check the note's location.\nStep 26: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"StudyGuides/NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon to access the note directly for moving it to \"DailyNotes,\" which successfully opened the note for further actions.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"NlwU_sure_penguin\" icon\nB. \"Undo\" icon\nC. \"Redo\" icon\nD. \"View mode\" icon\nE. \"Save\" icon\nF. \"Search\" icon\nG. \"More options\" image\nH. \"net.gsantner.markor:id/document__fragment__edit__text_actions_bar__scrolling_parent\" icon\nI. a text box with the text \"7dA80HOTbCLfyzXfuWG9\n\"\nJ. \"Check list\" image\nK. \"Unordered list\" image\nL. \"Ordered list\" image\nM. \"Delete lines\" image\nN. \"Open link\" image\nO. \"Attach\" image\nP. \"Special Key\" image\nQ. \"Date and time\" image\nR. \"Indent\" image\nS. \"Back\" image\nT. \"Switch input method\" image\nU. \"More features\" icon\nV. \"Sticker Keyboard\" icon\nW. \"GIF Keyboard\" icon\nX. \"Clipboard\" icon\nY. \"Settings\" icon\nZ. \"Theme settings\" icon\nAA. \"Voice input\" icon\nAB. \"Q\" icon\nAC. \"W\" icon\nAD. \"E\" icon\nAE. \"R\" icon\nAF. \"T\" icon\nAG. \"Y\" icon\nAH. \"U\" icon\nAI. \"I\" icon\nAJ. \"O\" icon\nAK. \"P\" icon\nAL. \"A\" icon\nAM. \"S\" icon\nAN. \"D\" icon\nAO. \"F\" icon\nAP. \"G\" icon\nAQ. \"H\" icon\nAR. \"J\" icon\nAS. \"K\" icon\nAT. \"L\" icon\nAU. \"Shift\" icon\nAV. \"Z\" icon\nAW. \"X\" icon\nAX. \"C\" icon\nAY. \"V\" icon\nAZ. \"B\" icon\nBA. \"N\" icon\nBB. \"M\" icon\nBC. \"Delete\" icon\nBD. \"Symbol keyboard\" icon\nBE. \",\" icon\nBF. \"Emoji button\" icon\nBG. \"Space\" icon\nBH. \".\" icon\nBI. \"Enter\" icon\nBJ. \"15:37\" icon\nBK. \"Android System notification: \" image\nBL. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nBM. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nBN. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nBO. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 25: Action executed, task still in progress.

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 15: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\nStep 17: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to continue searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" as it was not found in \"DailyNotes,\" indicating it may still be in \"StudyGuides.\"\nStep 18: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in \"DailyNotes\"; the note remains elusive, indicating further exploration is needed in \"StudyGuides\".\nStep 19: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further scrolling may be necessary or consider alternative navigation options.\nStep 20: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further actions may be needed to find the note or explore alternative methods.\nStep 21: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in both \"StudyGuides\" and \"DailyNotes\" folders; this action initiated a search process, which may help in locating the note more efficiently.\nStep 22: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 8}. Clicked on \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" to confirm the search, but the screen did not change, indicating the search may not have executed; next, I should click the \"OK\" button to perform the search.\nStep 23: The parameter index is out of range. Remember the index must be in the UI element list!\nStep 24: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 0}. I attempted to open the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by clicking on its icon, but the action did not execute as expected; I need to find an alternative method to interact with the note directly.\nStep 25: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 7}. Clicked the \"OK\" button to execute the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the search text was correctly inputted, but the expected results were not displayed, indicating the note may not be present in that folder. Next, I should explore other folders or check the note's location.\nStep 26: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"StudyGuides/NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon to access the note directly for moving it to \"DailyNotes,\" which successfully opened the note for further actions.\nStep 27: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 6}. I successfully opened the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by accessing the \"More options\" menu, which is necessary to move the note from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes\".\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"File settings\" icon\nB. \"Share\" icon\nC. \"Tools\" icon\nD. \"Info\" icon\nE. \"Reload\" icon\nF. \"15:38\" icon\nG. \"Android System notification: \" image\nH. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nI. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nJ. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nK. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 26: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 6}, Result: I successfully opened the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by accessing the \"More options\" menu, which is necessary to move the note from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes\".\nStep 27: Action executed, task still in progress.

Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into an editable text field (specified by its index), this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is:In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\nNow I want you to summerize the latest step based on the action you pick with the reason and descriptions for the before and after (the action) screenshots.\nHere is the description for the before screenshot:\nA. \"File settings\" icon\nB. \"Share\" icon\nC. \"Tools\" icon\nD. \"Info\" icon\nE. \"Reload\" icon\nF. \"15:38\" icon\nG. \"Android System notification: \" image\nH. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nI. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nJ. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nK. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nHere is the description for the after screenshot:\nA. \"File settings\" icon\nB. \"Share\" icon\nC. \"Tools\" icon\nD. \"Info\" icon\nE. \"Reload\" icon\nF. \"15:38\" icon\nG. \"Android System notification: \" image\nH. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nI. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nJ. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nK. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nThis is the action you picked: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 6}\nBased on the reason: I have successfully opened the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor and accessed the \"More options\" menu. However, I need to find the specific option to move the note from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\" The current UI elements do not provide any options related to moving or managing files directly. I should look for a \"Move\" or \"Move to\" option in the \"More options\" menu, which is typically where such actions are located. Since I have not yet explored the options available in the \"More options\" menu, my next step should be to click on the \"More options\" icon again to see if it reveals additional actions related to moving the note.\n\n\nBy comparing the descriptions for the two screenshots and the action performed, give a brief summary of this step. This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selection like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might not be correct), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short and in one line.\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action.

Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\nStep 17: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to continue searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" as it was not found in \"DailyNotes,\" indicating it may still be in \"StudyGuides.\"\nStep 18: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in \"DailyNotes\"; the note remains elusive, indicating further exploration is needed in \"StudyGuides\".\nStep 19: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further scrolling may be necessary or consider alternative navigation options.\nStep 20: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further actions may be needed to find the note or explore alternative methods.\nStep 21: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in both \"StudyGuides\" and \"DailyNotes\" folders; this action initiated a search process, which may help in locating the note more efficiently.\nStep 22: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 8}. Clicked on \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" to confirm the search, but the screen did not change, indicating the search may not have executed; next, I should click the \"OK\" button to perform the search.\nStep 23: The parameter index is out of range. Remember the index must be in the UI element list!\nStep 24: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 0}. I attempted to open the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by clicking on its icon, but the action did not execute as expected; I need to find an alternative method to interact with the note directly.\nStep 25: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 7}. Clicked the \"OK\" button to execute the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the search text was correctly inputted, but the expected results were not displayed, indicating the note may not be present in that folder. Next, I should explore other folders or check the note's location.\nStep 26: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"StudyGuides/NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon to access the note directly for moving it to \"DailyNotes,\" which successfully opened the note for further actions.\nStep 27: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 6}. I successfully opened the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by accessing the \"More options\" menu, which is necessary to move the note from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes\".\nStep 28: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 6}. I clicked on the \"More options\" icon to access additional actions for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but the current UI does not show any options for moving the note; I should explore further for a \"Move\" option.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"File settings\" icon\nB. \"Share\" icon\nC. \"Tools\" icon\nD. \"Info\" icon\nE. \"Reload\" icon\nF. \"15:38\" icon\nG. \"Android System notification: \" image\nH. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nI. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nJ. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nK. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 27: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 6}, Result: I clicked on the \"More options\" icon to access additional actions for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but the current UI does not show any options for moving the note; I should explore further for a \"Move\" option.\nStep 28: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning. Your answer should look like:\nReason: [Your detailed reflection and reasoning, including analysis of previous attempts if any]\nAction: {\"action_type\":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n",

Based on user's goal/request, you may\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a history of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don't have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on a UI element (specified by its index) on the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into an editable text field (specified by its index), this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\nThe (overall) user goal/request is:In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\nNow I want you to summerize the latest step based on the action you pick with the reason and descriptions for the before and after (the action) screenshots.\nHere is the description for the before screenshot:\nA. \"File settings\" icon\nB. \"Share\" icon\nC. \"Tools\" icon\nD. \"Info\" icon\nE. \"Reload\" icon\nF. \"15:38\" icon\nG. \"Android System notification: \" image\nH. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nI. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nJ. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nK. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nHere is the description for the after screenshot:\nA. \"Tools\" icon\nB. \"Speed Read\" icon\nC. \"15:38\" icon\nD. \"Android System notification: \" image\nE. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nF. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nG. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nH. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\nThis is the action you picked: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}\nBased on the reason: I have successfully opened the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" and accessed the \"More options\" menu, but I did not find any visible options for moving the note. The current UI elements displayed do not include a \"Move\" option, which suggests that I may need to explore other options or menus to find the functionality to move the note. Since the \"More options\" icon did not yield the expected results, I should consider checking the \"Tools\" icon, as it may contain additional actions related to file management, including moving notes.\n\n\nBy comparing the descriptions for the two screenshots and the action performed, give a brief summary of this step. This summary will be added to action history and used in future action selection, so try to include essential information you think that will be most useful for future action selection like what you intended to do, why, if it worked as expected, if not what might be the reason (be critical, the action/reason might not be correct), what should/should not be done next and so on. Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short and in one line.\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don't involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: ",

        "action_prompt": "You are an agent who can operate an Android phone on behalf of a user. You have advanced self-reflection capabilities that help you learn from mistakes and improve your performance. Before taking each action, you carefully analyze the current situation, reflect on previous attempts, and choose the most appropriate action.\n\nBased on user's goal/request, you may:\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks \"What is my schedule for today?\".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, a list of descriptions for most UI elements on the current screen will be given to you (each element can be specified by an index), together with a memory of what you have done in previous steps. Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- If you think the task has been completed: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"complete\"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible: `{\"action_type\": \"status\", \"goal_status\": \"infeasible\"}`\n- Answer user's question: `{\"action_type\": \"answer\", \"text\": \"<answer_text>\"}`\n- Click/tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Double tap on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"double_tap\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Long press on a UI element: `{\"action_type\": \"long_press\", \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Swipe in a direction: `{\"action_type\": \"swipe\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>}`\n- Type text into a text field: `{\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": <text_input>, \"index\": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_home\"}`\n- Navigate back: `{\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}`\n- Scroll the screen: `{\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": <up, down, left, right>, \"index\": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app: `{\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": <app_name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{\"action_type\": \"wait\"}`\n\n## Reflection Process:\nBefore each action, you should internally process through these reflection steps:\n\n1. **Situation Analysis:** What is the current state of the screen? What UI elements are available? What has changed since the last action?\n\n2. **Progress Assessment:** How close am I to completing the goal? What progress has been made? What obstacles have I encountered?\n\n3. **Memory Review:** What actions have I tried before? Which ones succeeded? Which ones failed? Are there any patterns in my failures?\n\n4. **Strategy Evaluation:** Is my current approach working? Should I continue with the same strategy or try a different approach? Are there alternative paths to the goal?\n\n5. **Error Analysis:** If previous actions failed, why did they fail? Was it due to:\n   - Wrong element selection (incorrect index)?\n   - Timing issues (screen not loaded)?\n   - Misunderstanding of the UI state?\n   - Incorrect action type for the situation?\n\n6. **Adaptive Planning:** Based on my analysis, what is the best next action? How can I avoid repeating previous mistakes?\n\n## Self-Reflection Guidelines:\n\n**Learning from Failures:**\n- If clicking an element didn't work, consider: Was the element actually clickable? Was it visible? Did I use the right index?\n- If scrolling didn't reveal what I expected, try scrolling in the opposite direction or with a different approach\n- If typing didn't work, check if the text field was properly focused or if there was existing text to clear\n- If an app didn't open, consider whether the app name was correct or if the app is actually installed\n\n**Recognizing Patterns:**\n- Are you getting stuck in loops? If so, break the pattern by trying a completely different approach\n- Are certain types of UI elements consistently causing problems? Adapt your interaction strategy\n- Are you making the same mistake repeatedly? Stop and reconsider your approach\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\n- Sometimes taking a step back (navigate_back or navigate_home) can provide a fresh perspective\n- Consider whether you're overcomplicating the task - is there a simpler direct path?\n- If you can't find an expected UI element, it might be in a different location or accessed differently\n\n**When to Give Up:**\n- If you've tried multiple different approaches and none work\n- If the required functionality appears to be unavailable or broken\n- If you've been stuck in the same place for several steps without progress\n\n## Common Failure Patterns and Solutions:\n\n**Pattern 1: Clicking wrong elements**\n- Problem: Clicking elements that look right but aren't functional\n- Solution: Carefully read element descriptions, check if elements are actually clickable\n\n**Pattern 2: Scrolling ineffectively**\n- Problem: Scrolling but not finding the target content\n- Solution: Try different scroll directions, scroll smaller amounts, or try scrolling specific elements\n\n**Pattern 3: Input field issues**\n- Problem: Typing doesn't appear or gets replaced\n- Solution: Check if field is focused, clear existing text first, ensure correct element index\n\n**Pattern 4: App navigation confusion**\n- Problem: Getting lost in app navigation\n- Solution: Use navigate_back strategically, return to home screen to restart, use open_app for direct access\n\nHere are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\nGeneral\n- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn't (you can see that from the memory), try to switch to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks \"what is my schedule tomorrow\", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like \"show me ...\").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it's already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE on the current screen and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to \"down\". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations\n- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nThe current user goal/request is: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes.\n\nHere is a memory of what you have done so far:\nStep 1: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"open_app\", \"app_name\": \"Markor\"}. Opened the Markor app from the home screen to access the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes,\" successfully transitioning to the app interface.\nStep 2: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 3: Can not parse the output to a valid action. Please make sure to pick the action from the list with the correct json format!\nStep 4: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 12}. Clicked on \"Folder StudyGuides\" to access its contents and locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" for moving it to \"DailyNotes\"; this action worked as expected, allowing further navigation.\nStep 5: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as it was not visible; this action was necessary to find the note for moving it to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 6: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the Markor app to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the note is still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to access it.\nStep 7: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unseen; further attempts to find the note may require additional scrolling or searching.\nStep 8: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder, as scrolling did not reveal it; this should help find the note more efficiently.\nStep 9: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\", \"index\": 3}. I successfully opened the search function in Markor and inputted \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box to locate the note, which is necessary for moving it from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes.\"\nStep 10: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"keyboard_enter\"}. Successfully inputted the note name \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" into the search text box in Markor; next, I will press Enter to execute the search and locate the note in the \"StudyGuides\" folder.\nStep 11: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"wait\"}. Waited for the screen to update after searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor, as I need to confirm if the note appears in the search results before proceeding.\nStep 12: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder after the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" yielded no visible results, as the note was not displayed; this may allow for manual location of the note.\nStep 13: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful search; note still not visible, indicating further scrolling may be necessary to reveal it.\nStep 14: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"up\"}. Scrolled up in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains unfound; further attempts may be needed to explore other folders or search methods.\nStep 15: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"DailyNotes\" icon to explore if the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" is located there, as previous attempts to find it in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful; the action worked as expected, allowing navigation to the \"DailyNotes\" folder.\nStep 16: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"DailyNotes\" folder to check for the presence of the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\"; the action was necessary to explore the folder's contents, as previous attempts to locate the note in \"StudyGuides\" were unsuccessful.\nStep 17: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"navigate_back\"}. Navigated back to the \"StudyGuides\" folder to continue searching for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" as it was not found in \"DailyNotes,\" indicating it may still be in \"StudyGuides.\"\nStep 18: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in \"DailyNotes\"; the note remains elusive, indicating further exploration is needed in \"StudyGuides\".\nStep 19: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further scrolling may be necessary or consider alternative navigation options.\nStep 20: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"scroll\", \"direction\": \"down\"}. Scrolled down in the \"StudyGuides\" folder to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but it remains elusive; further actions may be needed to find the note or explore alternative methods.\nStep 21: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 5}. Clicked the \"Search\" icon to locate the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" after unsuccessful attempts to find it in both \"StudyGuides\" and \"DailyNotes\" folders; this action initiated a search process, which may help in locating the note more efficiently.\nStep 22: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 8}. Clicked on \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" to confirm the search, but the screen did not change, indicating the search may not have executed; next, I should click the \"OK\" button to perform the search.\nStep 23: The parameter index is out of range. Remember the index must be in the UI element list!\nStep 24: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 0}. I attempted to open the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by clicking on its icon, but the action did not execute as expected; I need to find an alternative method to interact with the note directly.\nStep 25: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 7}. Clicked the \"OK\" button to execute the search for \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in the \"StudyGuides\" folder; the search text was correctly inputted, but the expected results were not displayed, indicating the note may not be present in that folder. Next, I should explore other folders or check the note's location.\nStep 26: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. Clicked on the \"StudyGuides/NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" icon to access the note directly for moving it to \"DailyNotes,\" which successfully opened the note for further actions.\nStep 27: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 6}. I successfully opened the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" in Markor by accessing the \"More options\" menu, which is necessary to move the note from \"StudyGuides\" to \"DailyNotes\".\nStep 28: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 6}. I clicked on the \"More options\" icon to access additional actions for the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt,\" but the current UI does not show any options for moving the note; I should explore further for a \"Move\" option.\nStep 29: Action selected: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}. I opened the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" by clicking the \"More options\" menu, but did not find a \"Move\" option; I should now explore the \"Tools\" icon for potential file management actions.\n\nHere is a list of descriptions for some UI elements on the current screen:\nA. \"Tools\" icon\nB. \"Speed Read\" icon\nC. \"15:38\" icon\nD. \"Android System notification: \" image\nE. \"Settings notification: Virtual SD card\" image\nF. \"Wifi signal full.,No internet\" icon\nG. \"Phone signal full.\" icon\nH. \"Battery 100 percent.\" icon\n\n\n## Previous Reflections:\nStep 28: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\nGoal: In Markor, move the note NlwU_sure_penguin.txt from StudyGuides to DailyNotes., Action: {\"action_type\": \"click\", \"index\": 2}, Result: I opened the note \"NlwU_sure_penguin.txt\" by clicking the \"More options\" menu, but did not find a \"Move\" option; I should now explore the \"Tools\" icon for potential file management actions.\nStep 29: Action executed, task still in progress. Current strategy seems on track.\n\nNow, before taking action, reflect on the current situation using the process described above. Consider what you've learned from any previous attempts and what the best next action would be.\n\nOutput your action in the correct JSON format, following your reasoning.
